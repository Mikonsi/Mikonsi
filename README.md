### About Me
I'm a Paramedic Supervisor transitioning into data roles.  In 2021 I started taking CS courses at Thompson River's University just for fun and learned programming in Java.  I quickly discovered Python and the data world.  As a paramedic, I started looking at a lot of our practices, from the way we handle fleet and logistics to how we distribute ambulances, and realizing they're all broken systems.
After becoming a supervisor I started getting involved in handling service data using my domain knowledge.  
That led me to enrolling in a Master's of Data Science at the University of Colorado.  But, I don't think I want to be a data scientist proper.  At my core, I want to solve problems and create the solutions myself.  I'm using ML to help identify issues we can improve, and statistical modelling to hypothisies solutions.
Then, I start working towards the solutions.

### Projects:
Traumatic Exposure Dashboard: Designed an intervention system tracking paramedic exposure to traumatic events, enabling proactive mental health support.

Offload-Delay Simulation: Currently building simulations to optimize ambulance coverage during hospital congestion, ensuring minimum coverage levels are maintained during demand surges.

### Technical Interests:
Core: Python, Rust, SQL.

Interests: Building custom CLI tools, resilient data pipelines, and high-performance systems.

Current Focus: Deepening knowledge in Rust and advanced Data Engineering design patterns.

I also love Elixir, but still need to build more projects with it.  Currently, I'm prioritizing learning Rust, and expanding my python to cover more data engineering topics.  

### Collaboration!
I'm always up to collaborate on projects, especially Emergency Services/Emergency medicine related research.  Feel free to reach out if you're reading this and looking for the same
